The list is located under the "Select a Design:" title.
Let's check more different designs to see how the CSS influences the presence of a web page.

1. After you browsed around download the sample [index.html](http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/index)
   and [style.css](http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/style.css) files and try it out.
   What can you do with the same page?
2. Do not change the html only the stylesheet!
3. Modify some CSS attributes:

* Change the background color of some parts of the site
* Change the font to a different one
* Change the text color
* Rearrange some parts of the page
